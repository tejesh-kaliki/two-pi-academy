## Degrees

Degrees are a unit of angle measurement commonly used in everyday situations.

- **Degrees:** A full rotation around a circle is divided into 360 equal parts, each part being 1 degree. Denoted by: the symbol $^\circ$.

- **Minutes:** Each degree is further divided into 60 equal parts, called minutes. Denoted by: the symbol $'$.

- **Seconds:** Each minute is further divided into 60 equal parts, called seconds. Denoted by: the symbol $''$.

## Radians

Radians are an alternative unit of angle measurement often used in mathematical contexts, particularly in calculus and trigonometry. One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.
$$
\text{Radians} = \frac{\text{Arc Length}}{\text{Radius}}
$$

One full revolution is $2\pi$ radians.

## Conversion formula

The following formulas to convert between degrees and radians:

- To convert degrees to radians: 
$$
\text{Radians} = \frac{\text{Degrees} \times \pi}{180}
$$

- To convert radians to degrees:
$$
\text{Degrees} = \frac{\text{Radians} \times 180}{\pi}
$$
