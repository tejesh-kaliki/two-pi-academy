# Sets test

1. Write the following sets in roster form:
    1. $A = \{x : x \in N \,\text{and}\, x^2 < 8\}$
    1. $B = \{x : x \, \text{is a letter in the word EXAMINATION}\}$
    1. $C = \{x : x \, \text{is a prime number less than 15}\}$

2. Write the following sets in set builder form:
    1. $A = \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \}$
    1. $B = \{ 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 \}$
    1. $C = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \}$ 
        *[Hint: These are factors of a number.]*

3. Find whether the following sets are equal:
    1. $A = \{x: x \in N \,\text{and}\, x \leq 2\}$ and $B=\{ x: x \,\text{is solution of}\, x^2-3x+2=0 \}$
    1. $C = \{x: x = 2n-1, n\in N \text{ and } n \leq 5\}$ and $D=\{ x: x \text{ is an odd natural number less than 10} \}$

4. Consider the following sets: $A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}$, $B = \{x : x \text{ is a factor of 6}\}$ and $C=\{ x: x \in N \text{ and } x \leq 3 \}$. Find which of the following sets are subsets of one another.

5. Consider the following sets: $A = \{ 2, 4, 6, 8 \}$, $B = \{ 2, 3, 5, 7 \}$. Then find:
    1. $A \cup B$ 
    2. $A \cap B$  
    3. $A - B$
    4. $B - A$

6. Let $U$ be the set of all triangles in a plane. If $A$ is the set of all triangles with at least one angle different from $90^\circ$, then what is $A'$?

7. Find sets $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that $A\cap B$, $B \cap C$ and $A \cap C$ are non-empty sets and $A \cap B \cap C = \phi$.
