# Test 1 -- Motion in a straight line

1. Consider a car that starts at rest, and gradually speeds up with constant acceleration for $t_1$ seconds. Then the car travels at that final velocity until time $t_2$ and finally slows down with constant acceleration, stopping at time $t_3$. Draw the position-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs describing this.

2. A truck initially at rest travels $100m$ in $5 s$. Assuming it's in uniform motion, find the acceleration of the truck. Also find the final velocity of the truck at $t=5 s$.

2. A ball is dropped from a building, and the velocity of the ball when it hits the ground is $10\,m/s$. Find the time taken for the ball to reach the ground and also the height of the building. [Hint: Initial velocity is 0]
