# Velocity & acceleration

## Average velocity:

The ratio of change in displacement to the change in time.

$$v_{avg} = \frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

## Instantaneous velocity:

The velocity of an object at a particular instant.

- At an instant, $\Delta t = 0$. Hence, take the *limit* of average velocity as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$.
- This is also known as _derivative_ of $x$ with respect to $t$.

$$v=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dy}$$

!!! tip "In uniform motion, average velocity $=$ instantaneous velocity"

## Average acceleration:
Total change in velocity by the total change in time.

$$\overline{a} = \frac{v_2-v_1}{t_2-t_1} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

## Instantaneous acceleration:
The acceleration of the particle at a particular instant.

$$a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
