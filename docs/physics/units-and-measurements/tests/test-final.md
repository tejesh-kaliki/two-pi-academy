# Units & measurements test

1. Write the dimensional formula of the following:
    1. Work
    2. Angular Velocity
    3. Frequency
    4. Gravitational Constant
    5. Planks Constant

2. Find whether the following formula is dimensionally consistent:
    
    $$T=\frac{k}{R}\sqrt{\frac{r^3}{g}}$$
    
    where, $T$ = time period, $k$ = constant, $R$, $r$ = radii and $g$ = acceleration due to gravity. 

3. If the following formula is dimensionally consistent, then find the dimensions of $a$ and $b$:

    $$ E = a g + \frac{1}{2} bv^2 $$

    where, $g$ = acceleration due to gravity, $E$ = Total energy, $v$ = velocity.

4. If the acceleration due to gravity of a planet depends on the gravitational constant $G$, mass of planet $M$ and radius of planet $R$, then derive an equation of acceleration due to gravity $g$.

5. The value of plank's constant in SI units is $h=6.626\times 10^{-34} \, Js$ [Joule second]. Find the value of planks constant in a new system of units which has gram [$g$], nanometer [$nm$] and half minute [$30 s$] as the base units of mass, length and time.

    !!! hint "$1nm = 10^{-9} m$"
